# My XMonad Config
This is just my personal XMonad configuration.
Currently I am using stack to build everything.
This has only been tested by me AFAIK on Manjaro Linux.

YMMV

For a slightly more detailed write-up about my XMonad config, and why I use XMonad, you can look at [My Personal Site](https://zrinsky.us/posts/xmonad "XMonad post at my website").

If you find this useful, please consider showing you care.
